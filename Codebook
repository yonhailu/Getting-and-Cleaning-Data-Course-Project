2.	Subject â€“ It is the identifier of the test subject

STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test

Downloaded the data and unzip the fielder into the working directory 

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
After assigning the names of the columns, Data were merged using cbing and rbing commands 
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Then we extract columns with the mean and standard deviations were extracted from the entire datasets and renamed using the names in the feature text files. 

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 Using the names in the activities text, the activities were given appropriate labels . 

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 Finally, we produced a tidy dataset that presents the averages of the subjects in each activity.
